--- Final IDLE Phase ---

=== All Transactions Completed ===
Total simulation time: 395000

=== Enhanced Simulation Summary ===
Testbench completed successfully
Check waveform file: axi4_lite_test.vcd
All AXI4-Lite transactions executed as per sequence:
  1. IDLE
  2. WRITE (0xDEADBEEF to 0x04)
  3. WRITE (0xCAFEBABE to 0x08)
  4. READ (from 0x04) - with verification
  5. WRITE (0x12345678 to 0x0C)
  6. READ (from 0x08) - with verification
  7. WRITE (0x87654321 to 0x10)

Enhanced features:
  - Read data capture and verification
  - Memory content monitoring
  - Improved waveform signals for read transactions
